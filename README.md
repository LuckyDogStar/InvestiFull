# Investifull

InvestiFull is software that provides topological 
information on fullerenes that exist within a given 
range of up to two hundred carbon atoms. InvestiFull 
is a python program that interfaces with an SQLite 
database, and the Fortran program ‘Spiral.f’ to 
produce topological information on the fullerenes

We did not develop spiral.f. It was retrieved from a 
github repository that has since been deleted. It is a 
popular fortran program used to produce topological information
on fullerene molecules.
